# Mystery Friend Machine Learning Project

Imagine finding yourself in such a scenario, where an anonymous friend sent you a postcard and did not leave a name, but the card is clearly addressed to you. Based on the handwriting, you have narrowed down the possible senders to three friends: Emma Goldman, Matthew Henson, and TingFang Wu.

To solve the mystery and find out which friend sent you the postcard, this project builds a friend writing classifier using scikit-learn's bag-of-words and Naive Bayes classifier. By using past writing samples from all three friends, stored in the variable friends_docs, This will classify the writing as related to one friend or another. Just like a spam filter can classify a message as spam or not spam, the friend writing classifier will determine which friend wrote the postcard.
